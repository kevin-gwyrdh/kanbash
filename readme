KANBASH

An opinionated kanban board written in bash.

original icyphox
this version hacks by gwyrdh

USAGE

kb add  COL STR         adds string to column
kb list COL             lists enumerated tasks
kb move COL NUM COL     moves from column to column, by number
kb all                  list all columns; default output when run without args
Added in this version
kb remove COL NUM		remove task
kb edit COL			    edit column file in editor
kb note COL NUM	        if task is a file name in board then this will open note file
kb copy COL NUM COL     copies a task from column to column

CONFIGURATION

This version 
kanbash expects a config file at $pwd/.kb/config
example config:
    
    # not completed
    in="in"
    
    # in progress
    work="work"

    # waiting to be zapped (validated/reviewed/held up)
    zap="zap"

Other column files can be created in $pwd it is just that they will not be shown with kb all
They can be viewed with list "name" and can have tasks moved into / from them

I sym link my todo.txt list into each of my project folders and can then copy in and out from this
    

    board=$pwd

board can also be specified by setting the KB_BOARD environment
variable; use absolute paths (/home/user/foo/bar).

WHY

Trello sucks .. and icyphox has made a good framework for hacking
